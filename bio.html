<p1>Hello there. As the title clearly states, my name is Jake Griffin Meyer. If you couldn't tell, the picture above this paragraph is me. This whole webpage is going to be about me so if you don't want to be bored, leave now.</p1>
<h1>Now, to start things off, here is a picture of my family</h1>

<p1>Ok, now that you know what my family and I look like, I am going to tell you a little bit about me...You've been warned: 
<ul>
	<li>I was born on December 10, 2004 at St. Joseph Hospital in Burbank, California to Joseph Andrew Meyer and Pandora K Meyer (fun fact: that was the same hospital Walt Disney died at in 1966).
	<li>My younger brother Finn was born exactly two years and two days after me (December 12, 2006. He shares his birthday with Frank Sinatra).
	<li>I went to elementary school at Toluca Lake Elementary (which is near Bing  Crosby's house) and the first two years of middle school at Luther Burbank Middle Schoool (Tim Burton also went there).
	<li>Have you noticed that all of those "interesting" facts about me contained some reference to a celebrity? Yup, my mind is crammed full of useless knowledge that will never help me in life. I'll stop with the pop culture references now. 
	<li>Anyways,
