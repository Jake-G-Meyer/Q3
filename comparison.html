	<h1>Comparison between Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame</h1>
	<h2>Here, I am going to compare two of my favorite movies of all time: "Avengers: Infinity War" and "Avengers: Endgame." These two movies follow the Avengers, a superhero team dedicated to serving justice, as they set out to stop (and later reverse) a reign of terror unleashed by the tragic alien Thanos.</h2>
	<h1 class=hulk>MAJOR SPOILER WARNING!</h1>
	<h1 class=hulk1>If you don't want these movies spoiled for you, don't read any of the points. If you've already seen these movies or have no interest in them, go right ahead.</h1>

		<p class=dread>"I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desparately that you're right, yet to fail nonetheless. It's frightening. Turns the legs to jelly. I ask you to what end? Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same. And now it's here, or should I say, I am?"</p>

		<h3 class=together>Usage of Characters</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>A major challenge that Avengers: Infinity War faced was balancing out its large roaster of characters in its 2 and a half hour runtime. The movie succeds in accomplishing this difficult task by giving each chaarcter rougly the same amount of screen time, with more time going to the characters who need more development (such as Thanos). However, some characters (such as Shuri and Hulk) don't contribute much to the plot, making them feel underutilized in the grand scehem of things. This was an inevitable outcome for a movie with 19 billed actors. </li>

		<h3 class="onetogo">The Final Battle</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>During the third act of Avengers: Infinity War, two battles take place: one in the fictional country of Wakanda and one on Thanos's decimated home planet, Titan. While these two battles are very exciting, they unfortunately fall into the long list of epic "good vs evil" battles that appear in every MCU movie. Like most MCU battles, the Wakanda and Titan battles depict all the characters in the movie fighting against the evil force that has plagued the movie. However, there is one major saving grace that saves the battles from being generic...</li>

		<h3 class="onetogo">The Ending</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The final scene in Avengers: Infinity War is undeniably the most shocking scene in the history of the MCU. At the end, Thanos obtains all six infinity stones, which will allow him to accomplish his lifelong goal: Kill half the universe so that the other half may prosper. When he snaps his fingers with the stone in his gauntlet, his wish is granted. When the credits appear on screen, the audience is left shocked after witnessing half of their favorite characters, such as Spider-Man and Black Panther, turn to dust. This scene was the most impactful ending out of any MCU scene because it was the first time in the history of this franchise that the villain truly won.</li>

		<h2 class=thanos>Avengers: Endgame</h2>
		<img src="images/theendgame.jpg" class="stark clearfix">
		<p class=decimation>"Five years ago, we lost. All of us. We lost friends. We lost family. We lost a part of ourselves. Today, we have a chance to take it all back. You know your teams, you know your missions. Get the stones, get them back. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs. Most of us are going somewhere we know, that doesn't mean we should know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. This is the fight of our lives. And we're going to win. Whatever it takes. Good luck."</p>

		<h3 class="natasha">Usage Of Characters</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>At the end of Avengers: Infinity War, half of the universe was wiped out, leaving Avengers: Endgame with half the roaster of charcters from Avengers: Infinity War. This means that characters who are making their departure from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Iron Man, Black Widow, Captain America) are given the focus they need while characters who are expected to shape the future of the MCU (Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, Dr. Strange) don't get nearly as much screen time. This is a good move because the characters with a lack of screen time will be developed in future movies while characters with the most screen time will be making one final impact before leaving. It's also a nice break from the wild whirlwind of characters present in Infinity War.</li>

		<h3>The Final Battle</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Despite, once again, falling into the same final battle formula that was mentioned in the other column, Avengers: Endgame manages to differentiate its battle from the other movie's battles by uniting EVERY character from both movies to defeat Thanos once and for all. As everyone who was revived from the dead shows to join the fight, the beautiful Avengers theme, composed by Alan Silvestri, creates an impactful feeling of excitement matched by no other movie in the MCU. To top it all off, Captain America finally says the famous line from the comics that fans have been waiting 22 movies to hear him say: "Avengers Assemble!" The final battle in Avengers: Endgame is a thrilling mix of </li>

		<h3 class=onetogo>The Ending</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Avengers: Endgame has a much less shocking ending than its predecessor does. In Endgame, Hulk uses the infinity stones to revive everyone who was killed in Infinity War while Iron Man uses them to wipe out Thanos and his army (Thanos is trying to obtain the stones for obvious reasons). Both attempts are successful and Thanos is killed, although Iron Man succumbs to the immense power of the stones and dies. This ending undoes everything that made the Infinity War ending so great, which is rather sad. However, the Endgame ending does redeem itself by giving a proper sendoff to Iron Man with a bittersweet and memorable funeral.</li>
